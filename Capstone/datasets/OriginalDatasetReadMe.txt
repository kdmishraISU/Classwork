Title: 
A dataset for microscopic peripheral blood cell images for development of automatic recognition systems

Summary:
The dataset contains a total of 17,092 images of individual normal cells, which were acquired using the analyzer CellaVision DM96 
in the Core Laboratory at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The dataset is organized in the following eight groups: neutrophils (wbc), 
eosinophils (wbc), basophils (wbc), lymphocytes (wbc), monocytes (wbc), immature granulocytes (promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes) 
(wbc), erythroblasts (rbc)
and platelets or thrombocytes. The size of the images is 360 x 363 pixels, in format JPG, and they were annotated by expert clinical 
pathologists. The images were captured from individuals without infection, hematologic or oncologic disease and free of any pharmacologic 
treatment at the moment of blood collection.

This high-quality labelled dataset may be used to train and test machine learning and deep learning models to recognize
 different types of normal peripheral blood cells. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available set with large numbers 
of normal peripheral blood cells, so that it is expected to be a canonical dataset for model benchmarking.
